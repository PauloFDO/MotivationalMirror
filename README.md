For fun a did a little project: if I stand in front of the mirror it goes to my google drive folder and plays a random audio from there, I then gave the link of that folder to my friends so they could upload whatever they wanted....the mirror spent a good amount of time motivating me to be a better person, I got called fat, ugly, a nice "are you talking to me", "stop looking at me or I will kick your ass" etc... I did a short video but the whole thing is pretty cringe, you don't want to see that, trust me
